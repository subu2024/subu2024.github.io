<h1>Common Machine Learning Algorithms Explained</h1>

<div class="content">
  <h3>Naïve Bayes Classifier Algorithm</h3>

<p>This algorithm uses Bayes’ theorem, which calculates probabilities based on prior knowledge. It’s effective with large datasets, especially when attributes are conditionally independent. Common uses include sentiment analysis, document categorization, and email spam filtering. For example, it can determine if an email is spam based on word frequency.</p>

<h3>K-Means Clustering Algorithm</h3>

<p>This unsupervised algorithm groups data into clusters based on similarity. For instance, searching for “Jaguar” on Wikipedia returns results about the car, animal, and software. K-means clustering can group these results by context. Search engines like Google use this to organize web pages.</p>

<h3>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h3>

<p>This supervised algorithm classifies data by finding a hyperplane that separates different classes. It’s known for its high accuracy and efficiency. SVM is widely used in stock market forecasting to compare stock performance within sectors.</p>

<h3>Linear Regression</h3>

<p>This algorithm shows the relationship between two variables and predicts outcomes. It’s commonly used for predicting housing prices, sales, weather, and employee salaries. Linear regression is straightforward, fast, and highly interpretable.</p>

<h3>Logistic Regression</h3>

<p>Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification tasks. It estimates the probability of an event based on given variables. Applications include disease risk factor identification in epidemiology and credit risk management in finance. It’s robust, handling non-linear effects and varying data distributions.</p>

<h3>Decision Tree</h3>

<p>This algorithm uses a branching method to represent decisions and their possible outcomes. Each node tests an attribute, branches represent outcomes, and leaves represent final decisions. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to explain. They handle both categorical and numerical data, making them useful in finance for loan applicant classification and in medicine for patient risk identification.</p>

<h3>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</h3>

<p>ANNs mimic the human brain with interconnected neurons. They adapt to environmental changes and improve through backpropagation. ANNs are used in financial institutions for loan evaluation, at airports for bomb detection, and by Google for speech and image recognition.</p>

<h3>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h3>

<p>This algorithm predicts outcomes based on the closest data points. It’s known for its accuracy, especially with non-linear data. KNN is useful for tasks where precise predictions based on proximity are needed, although there are more efficient algorithms available.</p>
