<h1>Evaluating Machine Learning Models</h1>
<p><small>published Date: Aug 2023&nbsp;|&nbsp;
    4 minutes read</small></p>
<div class="content">
  <p>How good is a machine learning model? This question is crucial, and the answer lies in how well we structure our data and evaluation processes. Let's explain this through a school analogy.</p>

<h3>Training Data (Class Lessons)</h3>

<p>Training data is like your favorite subject's class lessons. It's the foundation of the learning process. Just as you absorbed concepts and theories during class, machine learning algorithms use training data to understand the problem they're set to solve. For example, if your favorite subject was history, the training data would be the textbooks, lectures, and documents filled with historical facts. The machine learning algorithm processes this data, learning patterns and relationships, much like how you learned about historical events.</p>

<h3>Validation Data (Quizzes)</h3>

<p>Your teacher likely tested your knowledge through quizzes. These quizzes are like the validation data in machine learning. Their purpose is to assess how well you've comprehended the lessons and can apply the concepts. In machine learning, validation data checks if the model has genuinely understood and can apply what it learned during training.</p>

<p>For instance, if you're learning a new language, the validation data would be like conversation practice sessions. You're not just repeating phrases from a textbook; you're using your knowledge to engage in meaningful conversations, which demonstrates true understanding.</p>

<h3>Testing Data (Final Exam)</h3>

<p>Now, imagine the final exam at the end of the semester. This exam contains questions you haven't seen before, evaluating your true learning and ability to apply knowledge in new scenarios. This mirrors the testing data in machine learning.</p>

<p>In machine learning, testing data is a critical evaluation to determine if the model has genuinely learned and can apply its knowledge effectively. For example, if your final exam in biology (testing data) contained math questions after you'd studied biology (training data), it would be a disaster because you're applying the wrong knowledge, similar to using a model for a purpose it wasn't trained for.</p>

<p>Conversely, if your final exam repeated the exact same questions from your lessons, you might pass, but you haven't truly learned anything new. This is akin to overfitting in machine learning, where the model memorizes the training data but fails to generalize to new information.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Underfitting and Overfitting</h3>

<p>The real test of learning, both in school and in machine learning, comes when you're challenged with questions that require applying what you've learned in different ways. In the machine learning context, this is the purpose of testing data – to ensure that the model can adapt its knowledge to new situations effectively.</p>

<p>In summary, splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets ensures that machine learning models learn effectively, generalize to new data, and avoid the pitfalls of underfitting (where the model fails to learn) and overfitting (where the model memorizes without understanding). This structured approach guarantees that the model is well-prepared for real-world applications, much like a well-educated student ready to tackle new challenges.</p>
