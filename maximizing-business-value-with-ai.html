<h1>Maximizing Business Value through Strategic AI Investments</h1>
<p><small>published Date: Sep 2023&nbsp;|&nbsp;
    5 minutes read</small></p>
<div class="content">
  <p>Let's talk about Business Value in the context of AI investments. Think of spending money as buying something valuable. For instance, you might buy a phone because it helps you communicate and organize your life, which is worth more to you than the money you spent. The same principle applies to businesses investing in IT. However, research from Gartner reveals that about two-thirds of major technology investments do not meet their intended goals. Although companies often evaluate the costs and benefits before starting an IT project, only 13% reassess these factors after the project is completed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Business value refers to the return on investment (ROI), including both tangible and intangible returns.</em></strong> Different businesses use various metrics to define value, but the core idea remains the same. It’s not just about how much money you spend; it’s about what you spend it on, how you spend it, and how effectively you use it. This ultimately determines the value you get.</p>

<p>The journey from IT investment to business value can be tricky without a proper strategy. Businesses need to align their IT strategy with their overall business strategy to ensure they derive value from their IT spending. This alignment creates a framework that helps guide investments and achieve desired outcomes. Additionally, businesses must use effective communication and the right metrics to illustrate the value of IT investments.</p>

<p>Before investing in technology, there are some fundamental questions businesses should ask. Surprisingly, these questions are often overlooked, even though they are as straightforward as a child's persistent "why" questions. Here are the essential questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What business problem are we solving by investing in this technology?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Example: If a retail company invests in AI for customer service, it should solve the problem of long response times and improve customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
<li>Will the investment help achieve the strategic goals of the business?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Example: If a company's goal is to expand its market share, investing in AI for personalized marketing can help target customers more effectively.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
<li>Will the investment help in increasing revenue, cutting costs, or improving information management?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Example: Implementing AI in manufacturing can optimize production processes, reducing waste and lowering costs.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
<li>What are the risks involved in this investment? How do we account for future uncertainty?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Example: AI projects can face issues like data privacy concerns or implementation failures. Companies need to plan for these risks.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="5">
<li>Who are the owners of the investment? Who are the users?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Example: In an AI project, the IT department might own the implementation, while various departments like marketing or sales use the technology.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="6">
<li>How will value be measured? How much financial benefit will result?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Example: The success of an AI-driven sales forecasting tool can be measured by the increase in accurate predictions and resultant sales growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the decision to invest is made, it's crucial to continuously monitor the performance of the technology and evaluate progress. If the investment does not meet the business's needs, it’s essential to be flexible and willing to make changes or even abandon the project if necessary. This continuous assessment ensures that the business value is always aligned with the investment, maximizing the return and achieving strategic goals.</p>
